## Description
The left front camera image shows a wall on the left without any visible hazards or distractions aside from the cast shadow of a streetlight. There is no intersection or oncoming traffic visible from this angle.

The front camera image shows a two-lane road with the vehicle driving on the right lane. The left lane appears empty and clear for a considerable distance ahead. There is a teal car further ahead in the right lane, driving in the same direction. There is no visible traffic coming from the opposite direction. The road markings indicate a straight path with no immediate turns or intersections. There are no pedestrians, cyclists, or any other visible road users in the immediate vicinity. The road conditions appear clear and weather conditions look normal.

The right front camera image shows a continuous fence along the roadside without openings or intersections. There are no road hazards or vehicles visible in this image.

## Reasoning
Based on the navigation information, the goal is to stay in the current lane and continue straight ahead. The current speed of 7.119 m/s is appropriate for what seems to be an urban road, assuming the speed limit is within the typical range of 30-50 km/h. Since there is a car ahead but at a safe distance, there is no need to decelerate or accelerate unless that vehicle is traveling significantly slower than we are. There is no need to change lanes as the navigation instruction is to stay straight, and the left lane is empty, suggesting no immediate need for a lane change. Given the car's current lane position and lack of immediate obstacles or reasons to adjust the vehicleâ€™s speed or position, maintaining the current speed (IDLE) is the appropriate action.
